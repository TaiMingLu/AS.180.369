    "# Data Privacy and Utility in AI Models\n",
    "\n",
    "The balance between data privacy and utility is a crucial issue, particularly in the context of large-scale AI models. Differential privacy has emerged as a popular solution to protect sensitive information in datasets, but it often introduces significant noise, leading to reduced data accuracy and economic inefficiencies {cite}`privacy_ruggles_2024`. This trade-off has been further examined in the context of health disparities, where privacy measures disproportionately distort data for smaller populations, raising concerns about fairness and resource allocation {cite}`differential_santoslozada_2020`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional statistical disclosure methods have been defended as viable alternatives, suggesting that newer techniques like differential privacy may not always offer superior protection without substantial economic costs {cite}`rejoinder_muralidhar_2023`. In response, optimization frameworks have been proposed to find a middle ground, allowing for both privacy and data utility, though they require careful balancing to avoid significant losses in either area {cite}`balancing_hotz_2022`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The risks associated with privacy leakage from AI models, particularly in high-stakes sectors like healthcare and finance, underscore the need for better privacy-preserving techniques. Misuse of privacy mechanisms can lead to economic losses through reduced data reliability and non-compliance with regulations, making this a critical area for future research {cite}`limits_domingoferrer_2021`.\n",
