This text exaggerates the threat of AI-generated "counterfeit people," overlooking the potential benefits and nuanced ethical considerations.
While acknowledging the risks is important, the apocalyptic tone dismisses the ongoing efforts to regulate AI and the potential for technology to enhance, rather than destroy, human civilization. 
Imposing harsh penalties and strict rules could slow down _innovation_ and ignore the many ways AI can positively impact different areas, like healthcare, education, and science discovery. Instead of reacting out of fear, we should focus on creating fair regulations that allow AI to grow while keeping it safe.

The author mentions that AI-generated "counterfeit people" are almost impossible to resist, but they overlook the growing development of AI watermark technology and AI detection tools designed to help people identify when they're interacting with AI. Most people know when they're talking to an AI if they choose to pay attention; other times, they simply don't care.

The author claims that AI "weapons" can reproduce, but in reality, only large companies, driven by their own interests, have the resources to develop and reproduce massive language models with hundreds of billions of parameters. This isn't something individuals or small groups can easily achieve, so the threat of uncontrolled reproduction is exaggerated. The real challenge is in regulating these powerful entities, not in fearing widespread, uncontrolled AI proliferation.
