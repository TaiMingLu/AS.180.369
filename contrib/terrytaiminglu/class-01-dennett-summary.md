# Reaction to Dennett Article

This text exaggerates the threat of AI-generated "counterfeit people," overlooking the potential benefits and nuanced ethical considerations.
While acknowledging the risks is important, the apocalyptic tone dismisses the ongoing efforts to regulate AI and the potential for technology to enhance, rather than destroy, human civilization. 
Imposing harsh penalties and strict rules could slow down _innovation_ and ignore the many ways AI can positively impact different areas, like healthcare or education. Instead of reacting out of fear, we should focus on creating fair regulations that allow AI to grow while keeping it safe.
